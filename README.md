# Sod-Shock-Tube-Problem
Objective : To write C++ algorithms to solve and simulate Sod Shock Tube Probem

Following numerical flux schemes are implemented:
Finite Difference scheme: first order upwind scheme
Approximate Riemann solver:Roe solver

compared the results with standard analytical solution and graphs are plotted using tecplot 360
